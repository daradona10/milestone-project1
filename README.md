# DARRAGH MARTIN PROJECT MILESTONE 1: GYM WEBSITE

The deployed website can be accessed from:[here](https://daradona10.github.io/milestone-project1/)

#MAIN GOAL FOR THIS WEBSITE

This website was set up for a new gym in town and to provide gym users with information on the gym, the facilities that are provided,
the class timetables for people more interested in fitness classes instead and where exactly it is located.

## UX

The owner of the gym specifically asked me to design a website to showcase the new gym in town and to provide a user friendly vibrant website
to attract new members to the gym. The flow of the site was created for the avid gym goer in mind with clear navigation menu in mind and to avoid
too much congested information associated with other gym websites.

It was developed with the member in mind to be able to:

    * To showcase the gym facilities.

    * To provide them with the fitness classes on offer.

    * To outline the clear pricing options.

    * To contact the gym with ease via contact form or by phone.

    * To follow the up-to-date news via the social media links.

    * To browse the website via smartphones, tablets or PC desktops.

The end user will find this very easy to utilise and navigate.

* GYM USER MYSELF:

    * As an avid fitness bunny myself, I want to be able access the site with ease to see what facilities the gym carries and what are the main gym
      equpiment it carries.

    * As a fitness enthusiast I want to be able to see with ease what classes are on offer and when it is on and and what time.

    * As a member of the gym, I want to be able to navigate with ease to find the relevant information and quickly.

    * As a gym goer, I want to be able to contact the gym by various means whether through their website or by phone.

    * As a daily user of being on the internet for website that are of interest to me, it's important that the gym website is kep up to date also through
      their social media links.

    * As a user of the website, I want the site to function on any device.

### Wireframes

Wireframes for the mobile and desktop was done through Balsamiq. Both versions are listed below:

   # Mobile:[here](https://github.com/daradona10/milestone-project1/blob/master/development/wireframemobiledesign.pdf)

   # Desktop:[here](https://github.com/daradona10/milestone-project1/blob/master/development/wireframingdesktopdesign.pdf)

# Design Considerations:

It was decided to style the website with some vibrant colors and a darker main tone to move away from traditonal gym websites namely white and red tones

Bootstrap grid system was used, containers and components to make them so responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

Only HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstap used for this project.

# FEATURES

   * Navigate: Easy to navigate through Home page that allowed the user to easily navigate and easily click on one of the four functions at the top of the page
     or towards the bottom and that will take the user immediately to the option they picked.

   * Image Gallery: in the facilities page, allows the user to see images of the various equpiment we carry from cardio type machines, weight machines and free
     weights equpimentand a brief description of what equipment we provide under each section. The user can easily scroll back and forth to see the images in high
     resolution.

   * The user can read from some of our team members of what it means to them to be working in the fitness industry.

   * Classes: The user can see what fitness classes are available, what time it is on at and what day it takes place and they can also have a quick look at the
     progress bars to see whether they prefer to focus on strenght, cario, holistic or fitness type classes etc.

   * The class timetable can be viewed on a smaller device by scrolling across with their fingers and navigating up and down.

   * Videos: The user can view 2 of the videos that are currently on the website to see for themselves what to expect from 2 of the classes.

   * The videos used on this site are YouTube embedded videos. Allows the user to view these on smaller devices also.

   * Pricing: As with any gym, pricing is always one of the main features for a user to explore and we have laid out all the pricing options on offer
     and what is included. There is a brief policy notice that accompanies it underneath also.

   * Contact: The user can easily contact the gym through various means or directly through the website if they choose to do so instead. They can easily view
     the contact form on smaller devices and also fill out.

   * Location map: There is a location map also that users can see where the gym is located exactly and opens up to a new browser also.

   * Social Buttons: I have added the gym's socal media links at the footer at every page. This was done to help increase traffic to the various social media sites
     and keep users interested and coming back for more.

# Features Left to Implement:

    * I would like the user to be able to join the gym directly online through the website.

    * To have an online class booking system to show that the user has successfully booked into the gym of their choice.

    * To have regular news updates page to see whats new in the world of fitness and some healthing eating and training tips.

    * To have our personal training page and to be able to book a session with our trainers and to outline what they would like to focus on.

# Testing

Navigation Menu: Checked that the navigation links collaspe to naviagtion toggle on smaller screens, verified working correctly
                 -Checked that hovering over navigation links changed color, verified working correctly.
                 -All links to appropriate pages, verified working properly.

Navigation Questions: Checked that content is viewable in containers and structure looks good, stacked 2x2 on smaller screen sizes and adjacent
                      to each other on larger scales, verified working properly.
                      -On hover the questions should bounce on on desktop mode, verified working correctly.
                      -Links to appropriate pages when clicked on, verified working properly.

Footers: Checked that footer content is stcaked on top of one another for smaller screen sizes and adjacent to one another on larger screen size, verified
         working properly.
         -Checked that icon links to correct social media in a new page, verified working correctly.

During the initial testing stage the images were too big and did not fit properly on smaller devices also. First all the images were compressed
using resizeimage.net and then compressed along with adding another file name img-fluid. This allowed all the images to be rescaled properly across
all devices.

The table class outlay was proven problematic on smaller devices as didn't have the proper tools at my disposal to showcase it properly. I eventually inserted
overflow x-scroll tag that allowed the user to move it up and down and across with their finger on smaller devices. It allowed me to fit the whole table
and it worked better. Ideally I would have liked to have used a smaller screen using both a visible side bar and bottom bar to scroll within the parameters.

Contact page: Checked that content is viewable in conatiners and structured looked good and stacked on top of each other on smaller screens and adjacent to
               one another on larger displays verified working correctly
              -Try to submit empty form and it comes up first saying please fill out the first field
              -If you fill out first field and then press submit the same thing happens and asks you to fill out the field below it
              -If you fill out the email address section without the @ sign it will tell you that an email address needs to have the @ sign in it.
              -Once all fields are filled out correctly with no errors, verified working correctly.
              -Location map was embedded to work on all devices and to open in a new window also if the user wished to do so. Was verified and checked.

Facilities page: Checked that content is viewable in containers and structure looks good and stacked on top of each other on smaller devices also.

Classes page: Checked that content is viewable in containers and structure looks good and stacked on top of each other on smaller devives also.
               -The videos are all scaled across the devices properly.
               -The videos were embedded or else they would not load at all.

Membership page: Checked that content in containers and structure looks good and stacked on top of each other on smaller devices also.

Was tested on all the major mobile devices and also the larger tablet sizes along with Chrome, Firefox and on Safari. All worked ok and scaled well
according to the different screen sizes.

All the HTML code was tested via a HTML Validator [here](https://validator.w3.org/) and I'm currently aware of a warning for the 2 images on the team member photos on the facilities page but it also said unless
in special cirumstances and in this case which it is and I decide to leave that as it is.

In the classes page there was a few warnings re the table row columns but due to the complexity of this table and trying to make it responsive I have decided to leave this as
it is also. Also a warning to consider using a header element where the videos are located but it wasn't needed in this case so left it as a warning.
