#MAIN GOAL FOR THIS WEBSITE

This website was set up for a new gym in town and to provide gym users with information on the gym, the facilities that are provided,
the class timetables for people more interested in fitness classes instead and where exactly it is located.

#UX

The owner of the gym specifically asked me to design a website to showcase the new gym in town and to provide a user friendly vibrant website
to attract new members to the gym. The flow of the site was created for the avid gym goer in mind with clear navigation menu in mind and to avoid
too much congested information associated with other gym websites.

It was developed with the member in mind to be able to:

    * To showcase the gym facilities.

    * To provide them with the fitness classes on offer.

    * To outline the clear pricing options.

    * To contact the gym with ease via contact form or by phone.

    * To follow the up-to-date news via the social media links.

    * To browse the website via smartphones, tablets or PC desktops.

The end user will find this very easy to utilise and navigate.

*GYM USER MYSELF:

      equpiment it carries.

      their social media links.

#Design Considerations:

It was decided to style the website with some vibrant colors and a darker main tone to move away from traditonal gym websites namely white and red tones

Bootstrap grid system was used, containers and components to make them so responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

Only HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstap used for this project.

#FEATURES

   * Navigate: Easy to navigate through Home page that allowed the user to easily navigate and easily click on one of the four functions at the top of the page
     or towards the bottom and that will take the user immediately to the option they picked.

   * Image Gallery: in the facilities page, allows the user to see images of the various equpiment we carry from cardio type machines, weight machines and free
     weights equpimentand a brief description of what equipment we provide under each section. The user can easily scroll back and forth to see the images in high
     resolution.

   * The user can read from some of our team members of what it means to them to be working in the fitness industry.

   * Classes: The user can see what fitness classes are available, what time it is on at and what day it takes place and they can also have a quick look at the
     progress bars to see whether they prefer to focus on strenght, cario, holistic or fitness type classes etc.

   * The class timetable can be viewed on a smaller device by scrolling across with their fingers and navigating up and down.

   * Videos: The user can view 2 of the videos that are currently on the website to see for themselves what to expect from 2 of the classes.

   * The videos used on this site are YouTube embedded videos. Allows the user to view these on smaller devices also.

   * Pricing: As with any gym, pricing is always one of the main features for a user to explore and we have laid out all the pricing options on offer
     and what is included. There is a brief policy notice that accompanies it underneath also.

   * Contact: The user can easily contact the gym through various means or directly through the website if they choose to do so instead. They can easily view
     the contact form on smaller devices and also fill out.

   * Location map: There is a location map also that users can see where the gym is located exactly and opens up to a new browser also.

   * Social Buttons: I have added the gym's socal media links at the footer at every page. This was done to help increase traffic to the various social media sites
     and keep users interested and coming back for more.

#Features Left to Implement:

    * I would like the user to be able to join the gym directly online through the website.

    * To have an online class booking system to show that the user has successfully booked into the gym of their choice.

    * To have regular news updates page to see whats new in the world of fitness and some healthing eating and training tips.
